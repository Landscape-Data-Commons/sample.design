```{r setup}
library(sample.design)
```

Sometimes a design should be balanced around existing points. This makes it possible to maintain spatial balance even when combining multiple overlapping designs.

The way that this is done is to take existing points, both sampled and rejected, and compare them to a new design. From that new design, only the points with the farthest mean distance from the existing points are kept.

```{r farthest}
keep_farthest(existing_points = all_visited_points,
              new_points = new_design,
              target = 150)
```
